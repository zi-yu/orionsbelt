    </p>
      
    <ul>
      <li>Improved Visual Studio integration. In some Visual Studio
      installations, Clover.NET would fail with a Null Reference
      exception. This has been corrected</li>
      
      <li>The operation of the keyfile option has been fixed and the
          keyfile location is now propoerly quoted by the Clover.NET
          NAnt tasks</li>
    </ul>

            Solutions from the command line.</li>
        <li>New &lt;solution> NAnt task support allowing the use of Clover.NET
            in continuos integration environments which use the &lt;solution>
            task as the main build mechanism.</li>
        <li>Major performance improvements in the parsing and instrumentation
            phases of Clovering.</li>

    <h2>Visual Studio Plugin Installation</h2>

    <p>To install the Clover.NET Visual Studio plugin, please ensure you install
       the Microsoft VSIP interop assemblies beforehand and stop any 
       Visual&nbsp;Studio instances you have running.
    </p>

    <h2>NAnt 0.85 users</h2>
    
    <p>
        A recent change to NAnt after Release Candidate 3 is not
        backward compatible and breaks the Clover.NET tasks. When
        this code is release in RC4, we will issue an updated version of
        the Clover.NET NAnt tasks.
    </p>
